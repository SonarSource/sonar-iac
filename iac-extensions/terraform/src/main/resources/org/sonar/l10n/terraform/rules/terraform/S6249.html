<p>By default, S3 buckets can be accessed through HTTP and HTTPs protocols.</p>
<p>As HTTP is a clear-text protocol, it lacks the encryption of transported data, as well as the capability to build an authenticated connection. It
means that a malicious actor who is able to intercept traffic from the network can read, modify or corrupt the transported content.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The S3 bucket stores sensitive information. </li>
  <li> The infrastructure has to comply with AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to deny all HTTP requests:</p>
<ul>
  <li> for all objects (<code>*</code>) of the bucket </li>
  <li> for all principals (<code>*</code>) </li>
  <li> for all actions (<code>*</code>) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>No secure policy is attached to this bucket:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example-bucket" { # Sensitive
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}
</pre>
<p>A policy is defined but forces only HTTPs communication for some users:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example-bucket" { # Sensitive
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example-policy" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Id      = "ExamplePolicy"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "HTTPSOnly"
        Effect    = "Deny"
        Principal = [
          "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:root"
        ] # Only one principal is forced to use HTTPS
        Action    = "s3:*"
        Resource = [
          aws_s3_bucket.aws_s3_bucket.arn,
          "${aws_s3_bucket.aws_s3_bucket.arn}/*",
        ]
        Condition = {
          Bool = {
            "aws:SecureTransport" = "false"
          }
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>A secure policy that denies all HTTP requests is used:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example-bucket" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example-policy" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Id      = "ExamplePolicy"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "HTTPSOnly"
        Effect    = "Deny"
        Principal = {
          "AWS": "*"
        }
        Action    = "s3:*"
        Resource = [
          aws_s3_bucket.example-bucket.arn,
          "${aws_s3_bucket.example-bucket.arn}/*",
        ]
        Condition = {
          Bool = {
            "aws:SecureTransport" = "false"
          }
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}
</pre>

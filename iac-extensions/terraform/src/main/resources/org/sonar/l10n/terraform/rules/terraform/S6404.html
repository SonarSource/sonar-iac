<p>Granting public access to GCP resources may reduce an organizationâ€™s ability to protect itself against attacks or theft of its GCP resources.<br>
Security incidents associated with misuse of public access include disruption of critical functions, data theft, and additional costs due to resource
overload.</p>
<p>To be as prepared as possible in the event of a security incident, authentication combined with fine-grained permissions helps maintain the
principle of defense in depth and trace incidents back to the perpetrators.</p>
<p>GCP also provides the ability to grant access to a large group of people:</p>
<ul>
  <li> If public access is granted to all Google users, the impact of a data theft is the same as if public access is granted to all Internet users.
  </li>
  <li> If access is granted to a large Google group, the impact of a data theft is limited based on the size of the group. </li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing that changes in these cases is the ability to track user access in the event of an incident.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> This GCP resource is essential to the information system infrastructure. </li>
  <li> This GCP resource is essential to mission-critical functions. </li>
  <li> This GCP resource stores or processes sensitive data. </li>
  <li> Compliance policies require that access to this resource be authenticated. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Explicitly set access to this resource or function as private.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>For IAM resources:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_binding" "example" {
  members = [
    "allUsers",              # Sensitive
    "allAuthenticatedUsers", # Sensitive
  ]
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "example" {
  member = "allAuthenticatedUsers" # Sensitive
}
</pre>
<p>For ACL resources:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_storage_bucket_access_control" "example" {
  entity = "allUsers" # Sensitive
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_acl" "example" {
  role_entity = [
    "READER:allUsers",              # Sensitive
    "READER:allAuthenticatedUsers", # Sensitive
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>For container clusters:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  private_cluster_config {
    enable_private_nodes    = false # Sensitive
    enable_private_endpoint = false # Sensitive
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For IAM resources:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_binding" "example" {
  members = [
    "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.example.email}",
    "group:${var.example_group}"
  ]
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "example" {
  member = "user:${var.example_user}" # Sensitive
}
</pre>
<p>For ACL resources:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_storage_bucket_access_control" "example" {
  entity = "user-${var.example_user]"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_acl" "example" {
  role_entity = [
    "READER:user-name@example.com",
    "READER:group-admins@example.com"
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>For container clusters:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  private_cluster_config {
    enable_private_nodes    = true
    enable_private_endpoint = true
  }
}
</pre>

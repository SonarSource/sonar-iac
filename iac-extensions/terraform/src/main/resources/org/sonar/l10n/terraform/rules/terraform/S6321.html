<p>An AWS security group is a virtual firewall for EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. An ingress rule allowing traffic from all IP
addresses to standard network ports on which administration services traditionally listen, such as 22 for SSH, can expose these services to exploits
and unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to restrict access to remote administration services to only trusted IP addresses. In practice, trusted IP addresses are those
held by system administrators or those of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/linux-bastion/?nc1=h_ls">bastion-like</a>
servers.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>An ingress rule allowing all inbound SSH traffic:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_security_group" "noncompliant" {
  name        = "allow_ssh_noncompliant"
  description = "allow_ssh_noncompliant"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "SSH rule"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22 # SSH traffic
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # from all IP addresses is authorized
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>An ingress rule allowing inbound SSH traffic from specific IP addresses:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_security_group" "compliant" {
  name        = "allow_ssh_compliant"
  description = "allow_ssh_compliant"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "SSH rule"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["1.2.3.0/24"] # Compliant
  }
}
</pre>

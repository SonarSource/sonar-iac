<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or GCP support virtual firewalls that can be used to restrict access to services by controlling inbound and
outbound traffic.<br> Any firewall rule allowing traffic from all IP addresses to standard network ports on which administration services
traditionally listen, such as 22 for SSH, can expose these services to exploits and unauthorized access.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Like any other service, administration services can contain vulnerabilities. Administration services run with elevated privileges and thus a
vulnerability could have a high impact on the system.</p>
<p>Additionally, credentials might be leaked through phishing or similar techniques. Attackers who are able to reach the services could use the
credentials to log in to the system.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>It is recommended to restrict access to remote administration services to only trusted IP addresses. In practice, trusted IP addresses are those
held by system administrators or those of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/linux-bastion/?nc1=h_ls">bastion-like</a>
servers.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>An ingress rule allowing all inbound SSH traffic for AWS:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
resource "aws_security_group" "noncompliant" {
  name        = "allow_ssh_noncompliant"
  description = "allow_ssh_noncompliant"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "SSH rule"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>
<p>A security rule allowing all inbound SSH traffic for Azure:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "noncompliant" {
  priority                    = 100
  direction                   = "Inbound"
  access                      = "Allow"
  protocol                    = "Tcp"
  source_port_range           = "*"
  destination_port_range      = "22"
  source_address_prefix       = "*"  # Noncompliant
  destination_address_prefix  = "*"
}
</pre>
<p>A firewall rule allowing all inbound SSH traffic for GCP:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="3" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
resource "google_compute_firewall" "noncompliant" {
  network = google_compute_network.default.name

  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["22"]
  }

  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>An ingress rule allowing inbound SSH traffic from specific IP addresses for AWS:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
resource "aws_security_group" "compliant" {
  name        = "allow_ssh_compliant"
  description = "allow_ssh_compliant"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "SSH rule"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["1.2.3.0/24"]
  }
}
</pre>
<p>A security rule allowing inbound SSH traffic from specific IP addresses for Azure:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "compliant" {
  priority                    = 100
  direction                   = "Inbound"
  access                      = "Allow"
  protocol                    = "Tcp"
  source_port_range           = "*"
  destination_port_range      = "22"
  source_address_prefix       = "1.2.3.0"
  destination_address_prefix  = "*"
}
</pre>
<p>A firewall rule allowing inbound SSH traffic from specific IP addresses for GCP:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="3" data-diff-type="compliant">
resource "google_compute_firewall" "compliant" {
  network = google_compute_network.default.name

  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["22"]
  }

  source_ranges = ["10.0.0.1/32"]

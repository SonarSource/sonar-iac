<p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a managed message queuing service for application-to-application (A2A) communication. Amazon SQS can store
messages encrypted as soon as they are received. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium or otherwise leak a message
from the file system, for example through a vulnerability in the service, they are not able to access the data.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The queue contains sensitive data that could cause harm when leaked. </li>
  <li> There are compliance requirements for the service to store data encrypted. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to encrypt SQS queues that contain sensitive information. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently by SQS, so no
further modifications to the application are necessary.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/sqs_queue">aws_sqs_queue</a>:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_sqs_queue" "queue" {  # Sensitive, encryption disabled by default
  name = "sqs-unencrypted"
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/sqs_queue">aws_sqs_queue</a>:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_sqs_queue" "queue" {
  name = "sqs-encrypted"
  kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.enc_key.key_id
}
</pre>

<p>Creating APIs without authentication unnecessarily increases the attack surface on the target infrastructure.</p>
<p>Unless another authentication method is used, attackers have the opportunity to attempt attacks against the underlying API.<br> This means attacks
both on the functionality provided by the API and its infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The underlying API exposes all of its contents to any anonymous Internet user. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>In general, prefer limiting API access to a specific set of people or entities.</p>
<p>AWS provides multiple methods to do so:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>AWS_IAM</code>, to use standard AWS IAM roles and policies. </li>
  <li> <code>COGNITO_USER_POOLS</code>, to use customizable OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdP). </li>
  <li> <code>CUSTOM</code>, to use an AWS-independant OIDC provider, glued to the infrastructure with a Lambda authorizer. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>A public API that doesnâ€™t have access control implemented:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "noncompliantapi" {
  authorization = "NONE" # Sensitive
  http_method   = "GET"
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>An API that implements AWS IAM permissions:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "compliantapi" {
  authorization = "AWS_IAM"
  http_method   = "GET"
}
</pre>

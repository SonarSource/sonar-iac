<p>Excessive granting of GCP IAM permissions can allow attackers to exploit an organizationâ€™s cloud resources with malicious intent.</p>
<p>To prevent improper creation or deletion of resources after an account is compromised, proactive measures include both following GCP Security
Insights and ensuring custom roles contain as few privileges as possible.</p>
<p>After gaining a foothold in the target infrastructure, sophisticated attacks typically consist of two major parts.<br> First, attackers must deploy
new resources to carry out their malicious intent. To guard against this, operations teams must control what unexpectedly appears in the
infrastructure, such as what is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> added </li>
  <li> written down </li>
  <li> updated </li>
  <li> started </li>
  <li> appended </li>
  <li> applied </li>
  <li> accessed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the malicious intent is executed, attackers must avoid detection at all costs.<br> To counter attackers' attempts to remove their
fingerprints, operations teams must control what unexpectedly disappears from the infrastructure, such as what is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> stopped </li>
  <li> disabled </li>
  <li> canceled </li>
  <li> deleted </li>
  <li> destroyed </li>
  <li> detached </li>
  <li> disconnected </li>
  <li> suspended </li>
  <li> rejected </li>
  <li> removed. </li>
</ul>
<p>For operations teams to be resilient in this scenario, their organization must apply both:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Detection security: log these actions to better detect malicious actions. </li>
  <li> Preventive security: review and limit granted permissions. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a custom role grants a number of sensitive permissions (read-write or destructive permission) that is greater than a
given parameter.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> This custom role will be mostly used for read-only purposes. </li>
  <li> Compliance policies require read-only access. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>To reduce the risks associated with this role after a compromise:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Reduce the list of permissions to grant only those that are actually needed. </li>
  <li> Favor read-only over read-write. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>This custom role grants more than 5 sensitive permissions:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "example" {
  permissions = [ # Sensitive
    "resourcemanager.projects.create", # Sensitive permission
    "resourcemanager.projects.delete", # Sensitive permission
    "resourcemanager.projects.get",
    "resourcemanager.projects.list",
    "run.services.create", # Sensitive permission
    "run.services.delete", # Sensitive permission
    "run.services.get",
    "run.services.getIamPolicy",
    "run.services.setIamPolicy",  # Sensitive permission
    "run.services.list",
    "run.services.update",  # Sensitive permission
  ]
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>This custom role grants less than 5 sensitive permissions:</p>
<pre>
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "example" {
  permissions = [
    "resourcemanager.projects.get",
    "resourcemanager.projects.list",
    "run.services.create",
    "run.services.delete",
    "run.services.get",
    "run.services.getIamPolicy",
    "run.services.list",
    "run.services.update",
  ]
}
</pre>

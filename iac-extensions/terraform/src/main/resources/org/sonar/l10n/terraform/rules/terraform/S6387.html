<p>Azure RBAC roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. A role assignment grants permissions on a predefined set of resources
called "scope".</p>
<p>The widest scopes a role can be assigned to are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Subscription: a role assigned with this scope grants access to all resources of this Subscription. </li>
  <li> Management Group: a scope assigned with this scope grants access to all resources of all the Subscriptions in this Management Group. </li>
</ul>
<p>In case of security incidents involving a compromised identity (user, group, or service principal), limiting its role assignment to the narrowest
scope possible helps separate duties and limits what resources are at risk.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The user, group, or service principal doesnâ€™t use the entirety of the resources in the scope to operate on a day-to-day basis. </li>
  <li> It is possible to follow the Separation of Duties principle and split the scope into multiple role assignments with a narrower scope. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Limit the scope of the role assignment to a Resource or Resource Group. </li>
  <li> Apply the least privilege principle by assigning roles granting as few permissions as possible. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example" {
  scope                = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id # Sensitive
  role_definition_name = "Reader"
  principal_id         = data.azuread_user.user.object_id
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example" {
  scope                = azurerm_resource_group.example.id
  role_definition_name = "Reader"
  principal_id         = data.azuread_user.user.object_id
}
</pre>

<p>Using unencrypted RDS DB resources exposes data to unauthorized access to the underlying storage.<br> This includes database data, logs, automatic
backups, read replicas, snapshots, and cluster metadata.</p>
<p>This situation can occur in a variety of scenarios, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a malicious insider working at the cloud provider gains physical access to the storage device and exfiltrates data. </li>
  <li> unknown attackers penetrate the cloud providerâ€™s logical infrastructure and systems for extortion. </li>
</ul>
<p>AWS-managed encryption at rest reduces this risk with a simple switch.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The database contains sensitive data that could cause harm when leaked. </li>
  <li> There are compliance requirements for the service to store data encrypted. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>It is recommended to enable encryption at rest on any RDS DB resource, regardless of the engine.<br> In any case, no further maintenance is
required as encryption at rest is fully managed by AWS.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_instance">aws_db_instance</a> and <a
href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/rds_cluster">aws_rds_cluster</a>:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  storage_encrypted = false  # Sensitive, disabled by default
}

resource "aws_rds_cluster" "example" {
  storage_encrypted = false # Sensitive, disabled by default
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_instance">aws_db_instance</a> and <a
href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/rds_cluster">aws_rds_cluster</a>:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  storage_encrypted = true
}

resource "aws_rds_cluster" "example" {
  storage_encrypted = false # Sensitive, disabled by default
}
</pre>

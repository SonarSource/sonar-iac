<p>AWS resources that are launched into a VPC, such as EC2 or DMS instances, can have a private and public IP addresses. A public IP address allows
the corresponding instance to send and receive Internet traffic through the Internet Gateway and therefore exposing it to potential malicious traffic
like DDoS attacks.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<p>The instance launched in the VPC:</p>
<ul>
  <li> doesn’t need to communicate with the Internet. </li>
  <li> is not a public service. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>It’s recommended to avoid exposing instances on the Internet by assigning to them a public IP address, unless the instance is running a service
designed to be publicly accessible, such as customer portals or e-commerce websites. To communicate with instances in another VPC, consider using <a

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>DMS and EC2 instances have a public IP address assigned to them:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_instance" "noncompliantec2" {
  associate_public_ip_address = true # Sensitive, by default it's also set to true
}

resource "aws_dms_replication_instance" "noncompliantdms" {
  publicly_accessible          = true # Sensitive, by default it's also set to true
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>DMS and EC2 instances doesn’t have a public IP address:</p>
<pre>
resource "aws_instance" "compliantec2" {
  associate_public_ip_address = false
}

resource "aws_dms_replication_instance" "compliantdms" {
  publicly_accessible          = false
}
</pre>

<p>Azure Resource Manager allows creating custom roles that can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals. A custom role that grants access
to all resources of a subscription will have the same capabilities as the built-in Owner role.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to limit the number of subscription owners in order to mitigate the risk of being breached by a compromised owner. Having a custom
role that grants subscription Owner capabilities makes it way more difficult to enforce this limitation.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a custom role has an assignable scope set to a Subscription or a Management Group and allows all actions
(<code>*</code>)</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Apply the least privilege principle by creating a custom role with as few permissions as possible. </li>
  <li> As custom role can be updated, gradually add atomic permissions when required. </li>
  <li> Limit the assignable scopes of the custom role to a set of Resources or Ressource Groups. </li>
  <li> When necessary, use the built-in Owner role instead of a custom role granting subscription owner capabilities. </li>
  <li> Limit the assignments of Owner roles to less than three people or service principals. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
resource "azurerm_role_definition" "example" { # Sensitive
  name        = "example"
  scope       = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id

  permissions {
    actions     = ["*"]
    not_actions = []
  }

  assignable_scopes = [
    data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  ]
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
resource "azurerm_role_definition" "example" {
  name        = "example
  scope       = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id

  permissions {
    actions     = ["Microsoft.Compute/*"]
    not_actions = []
  }

  assignable_scopes = [
    data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  ]
}
</pre>

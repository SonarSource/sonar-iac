<p>The Google Cloud audit logs service records administrative activities and accesses to Google Cloud resources of the project. Itâ€™s important to
enable audit logs to be able to investigate malicious activities in the event of a security incident.</p>
<p>Some project members may be exempted from having their activities recorded in the Google Cloud audit log service, creating a blind spot and
reducing the capacity to investigate future security events.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The members exempted from having their activity logged have high privileges. </li>
  <li> Compliance rules require that audit log should be activated for all members. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>It is recommended to have a consistent audit logging policy for all project members and therefore not to create logging exemptions for certain
members.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "example" {
  project = data.google_project.project.id
  service = "allServices"
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "ADMIN_READ"
    exempted_members = [ # Sensitive
      "user:rogue.administrator@gmail.com",
    ]
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "example" {
  project = data.google_project.project.id
  service = "allServices"
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "ADMIN_READ"
  }
}
</pre>

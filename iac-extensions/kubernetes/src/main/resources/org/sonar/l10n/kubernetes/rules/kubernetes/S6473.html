<p>Exposing administrative services can lead to unauthorized access to pods or escalation of privileges inside pods.</p>
<p>A port that is commonly used for administration services is open or marked as being open. Administration services like SSH might contain
vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, or other security issues that increase the attack surface of a Kubernetes deployment. Even if the ports of
the services do not get forwarded to the host system, by default they are reachable from other containers in the same network. A malicious actor that
gets access to one container could use such services to escalate access and privileges.</p>
<p>If the administrative port is forwarded through a load balancer, then in most cases this port should be removed from the configuration to make sure
it is not reachable externally. Setting the <code>containerPort</code> on a pod is purely informative. Therefore, removing the property is not
sufficient to be secure. The port is still open and the service is still accessible.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is most secure to not start any administrative services in deployments. Instead, try to access the required information using
Kubernetesâ€™s own administrative tools. For example, to execute code inside a container, <code>kubectl exec</code> can be used. If the administration
service is included to access logs, Kubernetes suggests using a sidecar container with a logging agent.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The pod starts an administrative service. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to the question.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Do not start SSH, VNC, RDP or similar administrative services in pods. </li>
</ul>

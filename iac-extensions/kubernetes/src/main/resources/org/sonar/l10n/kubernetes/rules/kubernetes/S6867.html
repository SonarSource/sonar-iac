<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Using wildcards when defining Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions in Kubernetes can lead to significant security issues. This is because
it grants overly broad permissions, potentially allowing access to sensitive resources.</p>
<p>RBAC is designed to limit the access rights of users within the system by assigning roles to them. These roles define what actions a user can
perform and on which resources. When a wildcard is used, it means that the role has access to all resources/verbs, bypassing the principle of least
privilege. This principle states that users should have only the minimal permissions they need to perform their job function.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>If an attacker gains access to a role with wildcard permissions, they could potentially read, modify, or delete any resource in the Kubernetes
cluster, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or other malicious activities.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: example-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["*"] # Noncompliant
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: example-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>When defining RBAC permissions, it is important to follow the principle of least privilege. By explicitly specifying the verbs and resources a user
should have access to instead of using wildcards, it can be ensured that users have only the permissions they need to perform their job function.</p>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A memory limit is a configuration that sets the maximum amount of memory that a container can use. It is part of the resource management
functionality of Kubernetes, which allows for the control and allocation of computational resources to containers.</p>
<p>When a memory limit is set for a container, Kubernetes ensures that the container does not exceed the specified limit. If a container tries to use
more memory than its limit, the system will reclaim the excess memory, which could lead to termination of processes within the container.</p>
<p>Without a memory limit, a container can potentially consume all available memory on a node, which can lead to unpredictable behavior of the
container or the node itself. Therefore, defining a memory limit for each container is a best practice in Kubernetes configurations. It helps in
managing resources effectively and ensures that a single container does not monopolize the memory resources of a node.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Denial of Service</h4>
<p>Without a memory limit, a container can consume all available memory on a node. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where other
containers on the same node are starved of memory. These containers may slow down, become unresponsive, or even crash, affecting the overall
functionality and availability of applications running on them.</p>
<h4>Inefficient Resource Allocation</h4>
<p>When containers lack specified resource requests, the Kubernetes scheduler may not make optimal decisions about pod placement and resource
contention management. This could result in the scheduler placing a resource-intensive pod on a node with insufficient resources, leading to
performance issues or even node failure.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p>To avoid potential issues specify a memory limit for each container.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers: # Noncompliant
    - name: web
      image: nginx
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 100Mi
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>A limit can be set through the property <code>resources.limits.memory</code> of a container. Alternatively, a default limit for a namespace can be
set with <code>LimitRange</code>.</p>

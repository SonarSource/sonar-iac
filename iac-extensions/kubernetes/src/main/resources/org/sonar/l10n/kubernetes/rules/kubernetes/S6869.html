<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A CPU limitation for a container is a specified boundary or restriction that determines the maximum amount of CPU resources that a container can
utilize. It is a part of resource management in a containerized environment, and it is set to ensure that a single container does not monopolize the
CPU resources of the host machine.</p>
<p>CPU limitations are important for maintaining a balanced and efficient system. They help in distributing resources fairly among different
containers, ensuring that no single container can cause a system-wide slowdown by consuming more than its fair share of CPU resources.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Performance degradation</h4>
<p>Without CPU limitations, a single container could monopolize all available CPU resources, leading to a system-wide slowdown. Other containers or
processes on the same host might be deprived of the necessary CPU resources, causing them to function inefficiently.</p>
<h4>System instability</h4>
<p>In extreme cases, a container with no CPU limit could cause the host machine to become unresponsive. This can lead to system downtime and potential
loss of data, disrupting critical operations and impacting system reliability.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers: # Noncompliant
    - name: web
      image: nginx
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 0.5
</pre>
<pre>
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-limit-range
  namespace: default-cpu-example
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 0.5
    type: Container
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>A limit can be set through the property <code>resources.limits.cpu</code> of a container. Alternatively, a default limit for a namespace can be set
with <code>LimitRange</code>.</p>

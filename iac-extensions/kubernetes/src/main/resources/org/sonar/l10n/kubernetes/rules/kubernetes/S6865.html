<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Service account tokens are Kubernetes secrets created automatically to authenticate applications running inside pods to the API server. If a pod is
compromised, an attacker could use this token to gain access to other resources in the cluster.</p>
<p>For example, they could create new pods, modify existing ones, or even delete critical system pods, depending on the permissions associated with
the service account.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s recommended to disable the automounting of service account tokens when it’s not necessary for the application running in the
pod.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Unauthorized Access</h4>
<p>If a pod with a mounted service account gets compromised, an attacker could potentially use the token to interact with the Kubernetes API, possibly
leading to unauthorized access to other resources in the cluster.</p>
<h4>Privilege Escalation</h4>
<p>Service account tokens are often bound with roles that have extensive permissions. If these tokens are exposed, it could lead to privilege
escalation where an attacker gains higher-level permissions than intended.</p>
<h4>Data Breach</h4>
<p>Service account tokens can be used to access sensitive data stored in the Kubernetes cluster. If these tokens are compromised, it could lead to a
data breach.</p>
<h4>Denial of Service</h4>
<p>An attacker with access to a service account token could potentially overload the Kubernetes API server by sending a large number of requests,
leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec: # Noncompliant
  containers:
  - name: example-pod
    image: nginx:1.25.3
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-pod
    image: nginx:1.25.3
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>The automounting of service account tokens can be disabled by setting <code>automountServiceAccountToken: false</code> in the pod’s specification.
Additionally, it can be disabled in the configuration of an accompanied service account.</p>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Service account tokens are Kubernetes secrets to authenticate applications running inside pods to the API server. If a pod is compromised, an
attacker could use this token to gain access to other resources in the cluster.</p>
<p>For example, they could create new pods, modify existing ones, or even delete critical system pods, depending on the permissions associated with
the service account.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Unauthorized Access</h4>
<p>If a pod with a mounted service account gets compromised, an attacker could potentially use the token to interact with the Kubernetes API, possibly
leading to unauthorized access to other resources in the cluster.</p>
<h4>Privilege Escalation</h4>
<p>Service account tokens are often bound with roles that have extensive permissions. If these tokens are exposed, it could lead to privilege
escalation where an attacker gains higher-level permissions than intended.</p>
<h4>Data Breach</h4>
<p>Service account tokens can be used to access sensitive data stored in the Kubernetes cluster. If these tokens are compromised, it could lead to a
data breach.</p>
<h4>Denial of Service</h4>
<p>An attacker with access to a service account token could potentially overload the Kubernetes API server by sending a large number of requests,
leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>In this example, the service account token is mounted in the pod <code>example-pod</code> by default, but is unnecessary for the pod and its
service(s) to function correctly.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec: # Noncompliant
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
</pre>
<p>In this example, the service account token is mounted in the pod <code>example-pod</code> and is necessary, for example because it allows a
third-party service to authenticate with the Kubernetes API. However, no specific permissions are granted to the service account:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: example-sa # Noncompliant
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
</pre>
<p>In the following example, Role bindings are created, but Cluster Role Bindings would be more appropriate if the service account is intended to be
used across multiple namespaces:</p>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: example-sa
  namespace: default

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: example-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["list"]

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: example-role-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: example-sa
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: example-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: example-sa
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: nginx
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>The essential part of the solution is to make sure that permissions within the cluster are constructed in a way that minimizes the risk of
unauthorized access.</p>
<p>To do so, it follows a least-privilege approach.</p>
<ol>
  <li> If the service account token is unnecessary for the pod to function, disable automounting. </li>
  <li> If the service account token is required, ensure that the service account has the least amount of permissions necessary to perform its
  function. </li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, service account token automounting can be disabled directly from the service account specification file.</p>

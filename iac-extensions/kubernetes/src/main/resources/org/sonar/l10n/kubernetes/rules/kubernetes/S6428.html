<p>Running containers in privileged mode can reduce the resilience of a cluster in the event of a security incident because it weakens the isolation
between hosts and containers.</p>
<p>Process permissions in privileged containers are essentially the same as root permissions on the host. If these processes are not protected by
robust security measures, an attacker who compromises a root process on a Podâ€™s host is likely to gain the ability to pivot within the cluster.<br>
Depending on how resilient the cluster is, attackers can extend their attack to the cluster by compromising the nodes from which the cluster launched
the process.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The services of this Pod are accessible to people who are not administrators of the Kubernetes cluster. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Disable privileged mode.</p>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Ephemeral storage is a type of storage that is temporary and non-persistent, meaning it does not retain data once the process is terminated. In the
context of Kubernetes, ephemeral storage is used for storing temporary files that a running container can write and read.</p>
<p>The issue at hand pertains to the creation of a container without any defined limits for this ephemeral storage. This means that the container can
potentially consume as much ephemeral storage as is available on the node where it is running.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Resource exhaustion</h4>
<p>Without a defined limit, a container can consume all available ephemeral storage on a node. This can lead to resource exhaustion, where no more
storage is available for other containers or processes running on the same node. This could cause these other containers or processes to fail or
perform poorly.</p>
<h4>Unpredictable application behavior</h4>
<p>If a container exhausts the available ephemeral storage, it can lead to unpredictable application behavior. For instance, if an application
attempts to write to the ephemeral storage and there is no space left, it may crash or exhibit other unexpected behaviors.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers: # Noncompliant
    - name: web
      image: nginx
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      resources:
        limits:
          ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
</pre>
<pre>
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: storage-limit-range
  namespace: default-storage-example
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
    type: Container
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>A limit can be set through the property <code>resources.limits.ephemeral-storage</code> of a container. Alternatively, a default limit for a
namespace can be set with <code>LimitRange</code>.</p>

<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Ephemeral storage in Kubernetes refers to temporary storage that is non-persistent, meaning it does not retain data once the container or pod is
terminated. This type of storage is typically used for storing temporary files that a running container can write and read. Examples of ephemeral
storage include the containerâ€™s writable layer, emptyDir volumes, and log files.</p>
<p>The issue arises when a container is created without any defined limits for its ephemeral storage usage. Without these limits, the container can
potentially consume all available ephemeral storage on the node where it is running.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<h4>Resource exhaustion</h4>
<p>Without a defined limit, a container can consume all available ephemeral storage on a node. This can lead to resource exhaustion, where no more
storage is available for other containers or processes running on the same node. This could cause these other containers or processes to fail or
perform poorly.</p>
<h4>Unpredictable application behavior</h4>
<p>If a container exhausts the available ephemeral storage, it can lead to unpredictable application behavior. For instance, if an application
attempts to write to the ephemeral storage and there is no space left, it may crash or exhibit other unexpected behaviors.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>To prevent these issues, it is important to set limits on the amount of ephemeral storage a container can use. This can be done through the
<code>resources.limits.ephemeral-storage</code> property of a container. Additionally, a default limit for a namespace can be set using a
<code>LimitRange</code> object through <code>spec.limits[].default.ephemeral-storage</code>.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web # Noncompliant
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: ephemeral
          mountPath: "/tmp"
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web # Noncompliant
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: ephemeral
          mountPath: "/tmp"
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      resources:
        limits:
          ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: ephemeral
          mountPath: "/tmp"
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="compliant">
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: storage-limit-range
  namespace: namespace-with-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      ephemeral-storage: "10Mi"
    type: Container
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: namespace-with-limit-range
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: ephemeral
          mountPath: "/tmp"
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>By setting a limit on ephemeral storage, you ensure that a container cannot consume more than the specified amount of temporary storage. This helps
prevent resource exhaustion and ensures more predictable application behavior.</p>

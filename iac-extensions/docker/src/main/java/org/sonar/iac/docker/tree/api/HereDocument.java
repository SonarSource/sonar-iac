/**
 * Interface to define the contract of <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#here-documents">Here-Documents</a> form.
 * It is a way to structure and provide {@link Argument} to compatible instruction.
 * It extends from {@code ArgumentList}, it is a common interface from which extends any form that provide a list of argument, they are interchangeable.
 * This form is the most complex, as it expect keys with <<-? as prefix and can last over several lines, until we find a line with that key only.
 * Examples :
 * <pre>
 *   <<KEY val1
 *   val2
 *   KEY
 * </pre>
 * <pre>
 *   <<KEY1 val1 KEY2 val2
 *   val3
 *   KEY1
 *   val4
 *   KEY2
 * <pre/>

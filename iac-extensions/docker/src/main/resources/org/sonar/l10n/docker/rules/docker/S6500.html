<p>Installing unnecessary dependencies can lead to additional vulnerabilities in the Docker image.</p>
<p>Unnecessary dependencies are installed via a known Debian package manager. These unused dependencies might contain vulnerabilities, thus weakening
the overall security posture of the created containers.<br> Depending on the introduced vulnerabilities, a malicious actor accessing such a container
could use these for privilege escalation.<br> Removing the unused dependencies can also significantly reduce your Docker image size.</p>
<p>To be secure, remove the unused dependencies where possible and ensure images are subject to routine vulnerability scans.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Container vulnerability scans are not performed. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to the question.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Avoid installing package dependencies that are not strictly required. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
# Sensitive
RUN apt install -y build-essential

# Sensitive
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential

# Sensitive
RUN aptitude install -y build-essential
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
RUN apt install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential

RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential

RUN aptitude install -y --without-recommends build-essential
</pre>

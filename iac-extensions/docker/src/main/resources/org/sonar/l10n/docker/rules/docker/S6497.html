<p>A container image digest uniquely and immutably identifies a container image. A tag, on the other hand, is a mutable reference to a container
image.</p>
<p>This tag can be updated to point to another version of the container at any point in time.<br> In general, the use of image digests instead of tags
is intended to keep determinism stable within a system or infrastructure for reliability reasons.</p>
<p>The problem is that pulling such an image prevents the resulting container from being updated or patched in order to remove vulnerabilities or
significant bugs.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> You expect to receive security updates of the base image. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answer yes to this question.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Containers should get the latest security updates. If there is a need for determinism, the solution is to find tags that are not as prone to change
as <code>latest</code> or <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/faq#whats-the-difference-between-shared-and-simple-tags">shared tags</a>.</p>
<p>To do so, favor a more precise tag that uses <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> and target a major version, for example.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
FROM mongo@sha256:8eb8f46e22f5ccf1feb7f0831d02032b187781b178cb971cd1222556a6cee9d1

RUN echo ls
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Here, mongo:6.0 is better than using a digest, and better than using a more precise version, such as 6.0.4, because it would prevent 6.0.5 security
updates:</p>
<pre>
FROM mongo:6.0

RUN echo ls
</pre>

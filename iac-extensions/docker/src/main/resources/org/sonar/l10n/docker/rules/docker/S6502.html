<p>Disabling builder sandboxes can lead to unauthorized access of the host system by malicious programs.</p>
<p>By default, programs executed by a <code>RUN</code> statement use only a subset of <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a> which are considered safe: this is called <code>sandbox</code>
mode.</p>
<p>If you disable the sandbox with the <code>--security=insecure</code> option, the executed command can use the full set of Linux capabilities.<br>
This can lead to a container escape. For example, an attacker with the <code>SYS_ADMIN</code> capability is able to mount devices from the host
system.</p>
<p>This vulnerability allows an attacker who controls the behavior of the ran command to access the host system, break out of the container and
penetrate the infrastructure.</p>
<p>After a successful intrusion, the underlying systems are exposed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> theft of intellectual property and/or personal data </li>
  <li> extortion </li>
  <li> denial of service </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The program is controlled by an external entity. </li>
  <li> The program is part of a supply chain that could be a victim of a supply chain attack. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to either of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Whenever possible, the sandbox should stay enabled to reduce unnecessary risk. </li>
  <li> If elevated capabilities are absolutely necessary, make sure to verify the integrity of the program before executing it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1-labs
FROM ubuntu:22.04
# Sensitive
RUN --security=insecure ./example.sh
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1-labs
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN ./example.sh
RUN --security=sandbox ./example.sh
</pre>

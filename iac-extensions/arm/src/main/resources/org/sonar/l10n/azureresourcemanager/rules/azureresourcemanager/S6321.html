<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cloud platforms such as Azure support virtual firewalls that can be used to restrict access to services by controlling inbound and outbound
traffic.<br> Any firewall rule allowing traffic from all IP addresses to standard network ports on which administration services traditionally listen,
such as 22 for SSH, can expose these services to exploits and unauthorized access.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Like any other service, administration services can contain vulnerabilities. Administration services run with elevated privileges and thus a
vulnerability could have a high impact on the system.</p>
<p>Additionally, credentials might be leaked through phishing or similar techniques. Attackers who are able to reach the services could use the
credentials to log in to the system.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>It is recommended to restrict access to remote administration services to only trusted IP addresses. In practice, trusted IP addresses are those
held by system administrators or those of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/linux-bastion/?nc1=h_ls">bastion-like</a>
servers.</p>

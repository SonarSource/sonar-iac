<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>According to the best practices defined by Azure, a consistent order of elements in a templates is recommended. This makes it easier to read and
understand the template.</p>
<p>Not following this convention has no technical impact, but will reduce the templateâ€™s readability because most developers are used to the standard
order.</p>

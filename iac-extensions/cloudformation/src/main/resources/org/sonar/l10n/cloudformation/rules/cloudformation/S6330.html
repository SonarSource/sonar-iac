<p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a managed message queuing service for application-to-application (A2A) communication. Amazon SQS can store
messages encrypted as soon as they are received. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium or otherwise leak a message
from the file system, for example through a vulnerability in the service, they are not able to access the data.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The queue contains sensitive data that could cause harm when leaked. </li>
  <li> There are compliance requirements for the service to store data encrypted. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>It’s recommended to encrypt SQS queues that contain sensitive information. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently by SQS, so no
further modifications to the application are necessary.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-sqs-queues.html">AWS::SQS::Queue</a>:</p>
<pre>
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  Queue:  # Sensitive, encryption disabled by default
    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
    Properties:
      DisplayName: "unencrypted_queue"
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-sqs-queues.html">AWS::SQS::Queue</a>:</p>
<pre>
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  Queue:
    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
    Properties:
      DisplayName: "encrypted_queue"
      KmsMasterKeyId:
        Fn::GetAtt:
          - TestKey
          - KeyId

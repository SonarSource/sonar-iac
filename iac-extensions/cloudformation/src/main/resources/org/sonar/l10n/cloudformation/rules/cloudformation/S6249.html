<p>By default, S3 buckets can be accessed through HTTP and HTTPs protocols.</p>
<p>As HTTP is a clear-text protocol, it lacks the encryption of transported data, as well as the capability to build an authenticated connection. It
means that a malicious actor who is able to intercept traffic from the network can read, modify or corrupt the transported content.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The S3 bucket stores sensitive information. </li>
  <li> The infrastructure has to comply with AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to deny all HTTP requests:</p>
<ul>
  <li> for all objects (<code>*</code>) of the bucket </li>
  <li> for all principals (<code>*</code>) </li>
  <li> for all actions (<code>*</code>) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>No secure policy is attached to this S3 bucket:</p>
<pre>
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket' # Sensitive
</pre>
<p>A policy is defined but forces only HTTPs communication for some users:</p>
<pre>
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket' # Sensitive
    Properties:
      BucketName: "bucketname"

  S3BucketPolicy:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::BucketPolicy'
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref S3Bucket
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Deny
            Principal:
              AWS: # Sensitive: only one principal is forced to use https
                - 'arn:aws:iam::123456789123:root'
            Action: "*"
            Resource:
              - arn:aws:s3:::bucketname
              - arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/*
            Condition:
              Bool:
                "aws:SecureTransport": false
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>A secure policy that denies the use of all HTTP requests:</p>
<pre>
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket' # Compliant
    Properties:
      BucketName: "bucketname"

  S3BucketPolicy:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::BucketPolicy'
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref S3Bucket
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: Deny
            Principal:
              AWS: "*" # all principals should use https
            Action: "*" # for any actions
            Resource: # for the bucket and all its objects
              - arn:aws:s3:::bucketname
              - arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/*
            Condition:
              Bool:
                "aws:SecureTransport": false
</pre>

<p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a managed messaging service for application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P)
communication. SNS topics allows publisher systems to fanout messages to a large number of subscriber systems. Amazon SNS allows to encrypt messages
when they are received. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium or otherwise leak a message they are not able to
access the data.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The topic contains sensitive data that could cause harm when leaked. </li>
  <li> There are compliance requirements for the service to store data encrypted. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>It is recommended to encrypt SNS topics that contain sensitive information.</p>
<p>To do so, create a master key and assign the SNS topic to it. Note that this system does not encrypt the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Topic metadata (topic name and attributes) </li>
  <li> Message metadata (subject, message ID, timestamp, and attributes) </li>
  <li> Data protection policy </li>
  <li> Per-topic metrics </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, make sure that any publishers have the <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> and <code>kms:Decrypt</code> permissions for the AWS KMS key.</p>

<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-sns-topic.html">AWS::SNS::Topic</a>:</p>
<pre>

Resources:
  Topic:  # Sensitive, encryption disabled by default
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
    Properties:

</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-sns-topic.html">AWS::SNS::Topic</a>:</p>

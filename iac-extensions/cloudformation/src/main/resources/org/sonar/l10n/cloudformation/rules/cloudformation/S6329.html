<p>Enabling public network access to cloud resources can affect an organization’s ability to protect its data or internal operations from data theft
or disruption.</p>
<p>Depending on the component, inbound access from the Internet can be enabled via:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a boolean value that explicitly allows access to the public network. </li>
  <li> the assignment of a public IP address. </li>
  <li> database firewall rules that allow public IP ranges. </li>
</ul>
<p>Deciding to allow public access may happen for various reasons such as for quick maintenance, time saving, or by accident.</p>
<p>This decision increases the likelihood of attacks on the organization, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> data breaches. </li>
  <li> intrusions into the infrastructure to permanently steal from it. </li>
  <li> and various malicious traffic, such as DDoS attacks. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<p>This cloud resource:</p>
<ul>
  <li> should be publicly accessible to any Internet user. </li>
  <li> requires inbound traffic from the Internet to function properly. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered no to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Avoid publishing cloud services on the Internet unless they are intended to be publicly accessible, such as customer portals or e-commerce
sites.</p>
<p>Use private networks (and associated private IP addresses) and VPC peering or other secure communication tunnels to communicate with other cloud
components.</p>
<p>The goal is to prevent the component from intercepting traffic coming in via the public IP address. If the cloud resource does not support the
absence of a public IP address, assign a public IP address to it, but do not create listeners for the public IP address.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>DMS and EC2 instances have a public IP address assigned to them:</p>
<pre>
DMSInstance:
    Type: AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance
    Properties:
      PubliclyAccessible: true # sensitive, by default it's also set to true


EC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      NetworkInterfaces:
        - AssociatePublicIpAddress: true # sensitive, by default it's also set to true
          DeviceIndex: "0"
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>DMS and EC2 instances doesn’t have a public IP address:</p>
<pre>
DMSInstance:
    Type: AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance
    Properties:
      PubliclyAccessible: false


EC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      NetworkInterfaces:
        - AssociatePublicIpAddress: false
          DeviceIndex: "0"
</pre>

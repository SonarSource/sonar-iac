<p>A policy that grants all permissions may indicate an improper access control, which violates <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">the principle of least privilege</a>. Suppose an identity is granted full
permissions to a resource even though it only requires read permission to work as expected. In this case, an unintentional overwriting of resources
may occur and therefore result in loss of information.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<p>Identities obtaining all the permissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> only require a subset of these permissions to perform the intended function. </li>
  <li> have monitored activity showing that only a subset of these permissions is actually used. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to apply the least privilege principle, i.e. by only granting the necessary permissions to identities. A good practice is to start
with the very minimum set of permissions and to refine the policy over time. In order to fix overly permissive policies already deployed in
production, a strategy could be to review the monitored activity in order to reduce the set of permissions to those most used.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>A customer-managed policy that grants all permissions by using the wildcard (*) in the <code>Action</code> property:</p>
<pre>
MyPolicy:
    Type: AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy
    Properties:
        PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
                - Effect: Allow
                Action:
                    - "*" # Sensitive
                Resource:
                    - !Ref MyResource
        Roles:
            - !Ref MyRole
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>A customer-managed policy that grants only the required permissions:</p>
<pre>
MyPolicy:
    Type: AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy
    Properties:
        PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
                - Effect: Allow
                Action:
                    - "s3:GetObject"
                Resource:
                    - !Ref MyResource
        Roles:
            - !Ref MyRole
</pre>

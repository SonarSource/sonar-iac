[![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=SonarSource_sonar-iac&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=SonarSource_sonar-iac)

This SonarSource project is a [static code analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) languages such as CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
It is a component of the [SonarQube Server](https://www.sonarqube.org/) platform, and it runs the IaC features on [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/).

It enables developers to produce stable and easily supported [integrated code quality and security](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/for-developers/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=clean-code&utm_content=sonar-iac) by helping you find and correct vulnerabilities and code issues in your projects.

## Structure
This project is one analyzer/plugin that scans and raises issues on files associated with multiple languages.

The main registration point of the plugin to the API is in `sonar-iac-plugin`. The analyses of the different languages are separated into "extensions", 
which get loaded by the main plugin class and are structured similarly to other analyzers (i.e., parser, visitors, checks, rule resources, etc.)

## Build & Test

### Requirements
* Java 17
* Docker should be installed to perform the build of the Go part inside a container
  * In some environments, importing a custom certificate must be performed during the Docker build. Refer to the [dedicated readme](sonar-helm-for-iac/Readme.md#build-docker-image) for more details.
* Alternatively, to replicate CI setup and use system Go toolchain, set environment variable `CI=true`. Go 1.23 and the following dependencies are needed:
  * musl on Linux (`musl-gcc` should be present on `PATH`)

### Setup
To configure build dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init -- build-logic/common
```
To always get the latest version of the build logic during git operations, set the following configuration:

```
git config submodule.recurse true
```
For more information see [README.md](https://github.com/SonarSource/cloud-native-gradle-modules/blob/master/README.md) of cloud-native-gradle-modules.

### Build and run unit tests:
```shell
./gradlew build
```

### Build without running unit tests:

```shell
./gradlew build -x test
```

### Certificate issue during the build
If you are behind a corporate proxy, you might encounter certificate issues during the build, with following error:

```text
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx::yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: "/Sonar-FGT-FW-TLS-Traffic-Inspection.cer": not found
```

To fix the issue please copy the certificate to `sonar-helm-for-iac` directory or specify `-DtrafficInspection=false` property during the build:

```shell
./gradlew -DtrafficInspection=false build
```

### Fix code formatting issues

During the Gradle build, a spotless formatting check is executed.
This check can also be triggered manually with `./gradlew spotlessCheck`.
It checks if the code is correctly formatted using standard Sonar rules.
If your build failed, you can fix the formatting just by running:

```shell
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

### Update rule description

Update all rule descriptions.

```shell
./gradlew ruleApiUpdate
```

Update all rule descriptions for a specific language.

```shell
./gradlew ruleApiUpdateArm
./gradlew ruleApiUpdateCloudformation
./gradlew ruleApiUpdateDocker
./gradlew ruleApiUpdateKubernetes
./gradlew ruleApiUpdateTerraform
```

### Generate new rule description

To fetch static files for a rule SXXXX from RSPEC for one of the languages, execute the following command:
```shell
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRuleArm -Prule=SXXXX
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRuleCloudformation -Prule=SXXXX
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRuleDocker -Prule=SXXXX
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRuleKubernetes -Prule=SXXXX
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRuleTerraform -Prule=SXXXX
```

Additionally, an optional property `-Pbranch=<branch name>` can be set to fetch rule metadata from a specific branch.
